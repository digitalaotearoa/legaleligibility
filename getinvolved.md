Most of Digital Aotearoa projects are open source projects, and we welcome contributions of all kinds: blog posts, bug reports, and reviews of proposed changes are all welcome.

If you're an old hat at GitHub, go ahead and dive into the issues, or submit a PR. Every page on our sites has an "Edit page" link at the bottom. If you see something to add, find a typo, want to share your voice on a topic, submit a Pull Request and start a conversation with the community. 

If you want to learn more, join our Slack Community, introduce yourself and ask about our workshops to help you get started.
