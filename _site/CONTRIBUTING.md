# Contributing to Digital Aotearoa Projects

Most of Digital Aotearoa projects are open source projects, and we welcome contributions of all kinds: blog posts, bug reports, and reviews of proposed changes are all welcome.

If you're an old hat at GitHub, go ahead and dive into the issues, or submit a PR. 

If you want to learn more, join our Slack Community, introduce yourself and ask about our workshops to help you get started.
