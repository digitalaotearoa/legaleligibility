# Background

This project is to explore how might we ensure all gov systems provide explainability of decisions (a requirement of OIA section 23) to ensure appealability and access to justice for all? 

Everything we do must be lawful and compliant with myriad regulation and legislation, but how do we know that the representation of these rules in business systems is correct? How can we ensure there is traceability, explainability, compliance, auditability and appealability to these rules, especially for government systems and regulated entities? Without legislation/regulation as code, every department and every regulated entity is taking a guess in implementing these legal foundations in our services and business systems, which has created high cost, high complexity, and high inconsistency across communities and sectors. It is also rare to have systems in government departments that can determine the legislative basis for a decision or action, because legislation is blended with operational policies before being put into business systems, which are then often constrained by process and system limitations/rules that may conflict with legislative rules. Basically, without rules being available as code, we are creating rivalrous conditions which drive us to use lawyers as very expensive and variable modems to ineffectively and inefficiently regulate and manage society and the digital economy.

# Project description

This project has two parts:

1. Establishment of a community repository of New Zealand Government legislation and regulation as code, made publicly available, with four high value and impactful use cases that deliver immediate value to the general public, whilst also accelerating future opportunities. The initiative will grow the domestic rules as code community and capability through accelerating development in this space for all sectors. It will also create greater demand for explainable, equitable and appealable use of rules by government departments. 
2. Establish a service for anyone in New Zealand to anonymously learn what government services they are entitled and eligible for, as defined in legislation. Most eligibility criteria are prescriptive (age, income tests, relationship status, etc) but some benefits and services also have judgement-based rules. 

Our hope is that the service will help more people get what they are entitled to, and will feel confident to ask "why not?" if they are turned away. After all, [Section 23 of the OIA](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/DLM65628.html) clearly requires departments to provide an explaination of decisions relating to that person, but most people don't know that departments are legally required to provide an explanation of decisions relating to them. Our secondary hope is that all government systems would be traceable to law and their legal authorities, and would proactively provide these explanations of decisions/actions proactively to citizens.

# Current status

We are in very early stages, and are currently focusing on creating rules as code for key govt services that people seek help for from CAB.
