# Background

This project is to explore how might we ensure all gov systems provide explainability of decisions (a requirement of OIA section 23) to ensure appealability and access to justice for all? 

Everything we do must be lawful and compliant with myriad regulation and legislation, but how do we know that the representation of these rules in business systems is correct? How can we ensure there is traceability, explainability, compliance, auditability and appealability to these rules, especially for government systems and regulated entities? Without legislation/regulation as code, every department and every regulated entity is taking a guess in implementing these legal foundations in our services and business systems, which has created high cost, high complexity, and high inconsistency across communities and sectors. It is also rare to have systems in government departments that can determine the legislative basis for a decision or action, because legislation is blended with operational policies before being put into business systems, which are then often constrained by process and system limitations/rules that may conflict with legislative rules. Basically, without rules being available as code, we are creating rivalrous conditions which drive us to use lawyers as very expensive and variable modems to ineffectively and inefficiently regulate and manage society and the digital economy.



# Current status

We are in very early stages, and are currently focusing on creating rules as code for key govt services that people seek help for from CAB.
